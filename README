# SLP Algorithm

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- julia 
- make
- zip (command-line tool)

### julia
julia can be installed by following the guide on the [Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/), or simply by typing the following into the terminal:
- Unix-Like System: `curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh`
- Windows: `winget install julia -s msstore`

This installs [Juliaup installation manager](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), which will automatically install julia and keep it up to date. To install different versions of julia, use `juliaup --help`

Juliaup does not directly install the command "julia", instead, it provides a executable called "julialauncher" which will run julia programs using the specified julia version in the juliaup installation manager. 

If julia is installed directly on your computer, replace "JULIA = julialauncher" with "JULIA = julia" in the Makefile. 

### make and zip
Both of these are command line tools and some systems comes with them and some doesn't. You can install them using your package manager:
- On Unix-Like Systems: `sudo apt-get install make zip` (for Debian-based systems) or `sudo yum install make zip` (for Red Hat-based systems).
- On macOS: `brew install make zip`
- On Windows: Make is available via [GnuWin](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm), and zip is available via [Info-ZIP](http://infozip.sourceforge.net/).


## Makefile Targets
- "make run": Runs "make check_install" and Runs the SLP.jl
- "make zip": Runs "make clean" and compresses the files in the same directory to create SlP.zip
- "make clean": Cleans the working directory(removing existing SLP.zip and extracted folder SLP)
- "make check_install": Runs check_dep.jl and installs any dependencies needed

### Default Target
The default target runs the SLP program, i.e. running "make" is the same as running "make run"

## Files
This project contains the following files:
- check_dep.jl: This is the julia program that checks for any missing dependencies required for running SLP.jl and installs them if needed. 
- SLP.jl: This is the main program that implements the logic for the SLP algorithm 
- parser.jl: Helper julia file that includes functions that takes care of the parsing of the polynomial into SLP form. 
- polyExpander.jl: Helper julia file that includes functions that expand polynomials into expanded form
- utils.jl: Helper julia file that includes any useful helper functions
- Makefile: This is the Makefile specifying targets for the make command 
- README: This file. 
- input.txt: This is the file that stores the input that SLP.jl takes from. 
  - Each line is consists of a polynomial, followed by the point at which you would like to evaluate the polynomial at.
    - For example, if a line is written like this: "3x^2y + 5xy^2 + 4z^3 - 6,x=5,y=2,z=3", then it means the polynomial is 3x^2y + 5xy^2 + 4z^3 - 6 with evaluated at x=5,y=2,z=3. 
    - Optional argument representing description at the end enclosed with quotation marks. Ex. x^4-x^3-x^2-2x+2, x=5, "(1) Golden ratio" 
  - Ignores empty lines and lines starting with "#"
- Feel free to add more input files for your own testing, but remember to change the argument in order to run the program on your desired input file. See [Usage](#Usage)


## Usage
To run the program, use the following commands:

- To run the Julia program with default argument(input.txt)
  ```sh
  make run
- To run the Julia program with additional arguments: 
  ```sh
  make run ARGS="Your_file_name1.txt Your_file_name2.txt..."
